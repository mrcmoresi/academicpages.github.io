* During 2020, I spent one year in the Dialog Systems and Machine Learning group directed by [Prof. Dr. Milica Gašić](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=yDSBDJoAAAAJ) Working on how to evaluate Natural language generation for Dialogue Systems. I proposed a variation of a new metric and a new pipeline to evaluate the systems. With the main objective to tackle the drawbacks of the actual metrics without incorporating humans in the loop.

* In 2019, I received my Master Degree in Computer Science in the Computer Science Department at [FaMAF](www.famaf.unc.edu.ar). My thesis was directed by  Thesis Directors: [Prof Dr. Benotti Luciana](https://benotti.github.io/), [Dr. Gomez Marcos](https://scholar.google.com.ar/citations?user=FTHzyOEAAAAJ&hl=en). Topic of the thesis: Machine Learning applied to predict dropout in programming students. Disertation mark 10 over 10. [[Master Thesis]](files/moresi_msc_thesis.pdf)


* In 2016, I received my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, [Facultad de Matemática, Astronomía, Física, y Computación](www.famaf.unc.edu.ar), [Universidad Nacional de Córdoba](https://www.unc.edu.ar/).

* My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in speech, language and dialogue processing as well as their applications in intelligent tutoring system, natural language understanding and others. I am passionate about exploring large datasets and find insights that can
be utilised to improve or create web applications and business solutions. I am constantly
expanding my knowledge when creating and developing new tools and services. In addition, part of my heart is in Computer Vision systems because those were the first applications of machine learning that I have learned about.
